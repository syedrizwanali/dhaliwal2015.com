      <div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>1 ) WHO IS BOBBY DHALIWAL? </h1><p class="answer">Bobby Dhaliwal is me, he’s you, he's everyone and their goat.  He's got an eye for justice and he's looking out for the 99%, because unlike the other folks, he IS the 99%.  He's not a career politician; he actually gives a damn and tells it like it is. He's got nothing to lose other than the support of the wealthiest corporations who are screwing the planet and its people to a point of no return.  Speaking of which, please buy a t-shirt cuz campaigns are expensive and like many recent grads, he's broke and in debt already.  Thanks.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>2 ) WHAT IS BOBBY'S VISION FOR CANADA?</h1><p class="answer">Is it just us at camp Dhaliwal, or is someone totally screwing with our basic human rights?  HTF did C-51, and C-24 pass on the sly?  Why does Harper think that sending body bags to Aboriginal reservations is a form of healthcare anytime there's a flu scare?  There was another guy whose name began with an H that pulled that kinda shit.  How can a responsible government "balance" our budget using our emergency contingency fund reserved for major catastrophic disasters?  Who’s paying for Harper's makeup and stylist?  I mean, both Harper and Duffy look fiiiiiiine… but WTF?  Oh yeah, FYI Canada just got booted out of the list of top ten developed nations – tip o' the hat to you Stephen! When global oil prices were manipulated, guess who got screwed the most – WE DID!!!  An actual leader who was looking out for us wouldn't let this happen, and now we’re heading for a recession. Yes, this was a rant rather than an answer, but you get the point.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>3 ) WHAT ISSUES MATTER THE MOST TO CANADIANS?</h1><p class="answer">Poverty, supporting Indigenous communities and following their lead, getting students out of debt so that they can contribute their best to the broader society, improving the quality of life for children through affordable childcare and a mandatory minimum LIVING wage, obliterating the gender GAP asap, getting rid of entitled wasteful senators, transitioning to a green economy… Basically everything most Canadians know to be right and good.  Abolishing C-51, and C-24… the economic divide between the haves and have-nots… this is some serious Robin Hood shit here… there's a lot to be done, so let’s "get the ball to Dhaliwal!"…it does have a nice ring to it doesn't it?</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>4 ) DOES BOBBY SMOKE MARIJUANA?</h1><p class="answer">Medical research has proven that marijuana is…like… Kaye, you know when something's "bad", but then it’s good, and people are like – whoa! It's like that. And—it’s not like its cigarettes, or alcohol or oxy or crack….Wait, what was the question?</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>5 ) IS BOBBY GAY?</h1><p class="answer">Questions like this are best left unanswered as to not pander to homophobic skeptics.  Who's writing these, an unpaid intern? Sheesh!</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>6 ) WHY IS BOBBY RUNNING FOR PRIME MINISTER?</h1><p class="answer">Refer to Q. 2 & 3, and then ask yourself why you're not running as well!</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>7 ) WAS BOBBY BORN IN CANADA?</h1><p class="answer">Hmm… why not ask Donald Trump about Bobby? I'm sure he will come up with an answer that isn't riddled with racist idiocy.  That guy is amazing… the escalator… the blatant neo-Nazi presidential launch!!</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>8 ) WHAT MAKES BOBBY QUALIFIED TO BE PRIME MINISTER?</h1><p class="answer">Errr…  Well, the one thing that people ask for in a leader, and the one thing they never get is HONESTY.   Bobby will at least give you that.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>9 ) IS BOBBY A SOCIALIST?</h1><p class="answer">Bobby believes in taking care of one another. When did that become such a bad thing?!  Oh right, when we entered the capitalist apocalypse.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>10 ) WHAT IS THE "DROP AND GIVE ME 10 CHALLENGE"?</h1><p class="answer">'Bobby challenges Canadians to do 10 (real) push-ups and/or donate $10 towards Wounded Warriors' Animal Assisted Therapy Programs for vets suffering with mental illness and PTSD. Shape up Canada and nominate your friends!</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>11 ) WHAT DOES A TUITION FREE CANADA LOOK LIKE?</h1><p class="answer">It looks like Argentina, Brazil, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden… but with more poutine.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>12 ) WHAT IS BOBBY'S STANCE ON THE MIDDLE EAST?</h1><p class="answer">He agrees with Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela… so check it!</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>13 ) WHAT WOULD BOBBY’S CABINET LOOK LIKE?</h1><p class="answer">Reclaimed oak and some mahogany on the trim.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>14 ) CAN BOBBY END RACISM?</h1><p class="answer">No, but he can make racists super uncomfortable.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>15 ) WHAT IS BOBBY'S TAKE ON QUEBEC?</h1><p class="answer">He’s just happy he's allowed to play soccer there again.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>16 ) IS BOBBY A TERRORIST?</h1><p class="answer">You mean like the way Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela were called "terrorists"? Or do you mean like a white guy who opens fire at innocent Black people at church?</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>17 ) DOES BOBBY LOVE THAT SOCIALIST OBAMA OR SOMETHING?</h1><p class="answer">No...although it was pretty dope watching a family of Colour take the office in 2008. Boy did that dream die hard though. Stop killing innocent civilians in your plethora of wars Nobel Peace Laureate! Drones should ONLY be used for delivering pizza… when you are baked.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>18 ) WHAT ARE BOBBY'S THOUGHTS ON THE ELECTION SOUTH OF THE BORDER?</h1><p class="answer">BERNIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! xoxoxoxoxoxo Wait, has Nader made an announcement yet?</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>19 ) IF BOBBY COULDN'T VOTE FOR HIMSELF WHO WOULD GET HIS VOTE?</h1><p class="answer">Buffy Sainte-Marie.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>20 ) WHAT IS "DHALIWAL-O-CARE"?</h1><p class="answer">It's a comprehensive National Pharmacare Program.  Life-saving drugs that the average person would struggle to afford if their insurance wouldn't cover it, or preventative meds that keep people from congesting our ERs, would be covered by a Government that actually cares and is invested in making universal healthcare a functional reality.  The government is in a better position in negotiating wholesale prices with Big Pharma than anyone else, so why aren't they looking out for us?  The result is an overall reduction in healthcare costs in the long run, healthier Canadians, and a better quality of life.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>21 ) DOES BOBBY DHALIWAL INTEND TO ABOLISH THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX?</h1><p class="answer">The short answer is YES.  Our prisons are being flooded with an over-representation of Aboriginal People and People of Colour, so unless we're on the same page as the KKK, we should not support such a system. Period.  Meanwhile People of Colour and Aboriginal People are underrepresented in institutions of Power (uhhhmm… Parliament)... in whole, this is a very scary reality, and we need to face it to deal with it.  Don’t even get me started on carding… that is some pre-American civil war shit.</p></div><div class="row question"><h1 class=""><span class="caret"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></span>22 ) IS CANADA HEADING INTO A RECESSION?</h1><p class="answer">Good question. The loonie is at a ten year low and it hasn’t seen bottom. Alberta just had one of it's largest oil spills during a time where our oil-based-economy is crippling beneath us. Canada was the largest hit country in the world as a result of a decline in oil prices. We were recently dropped from the list of the top ten most developed nations in the world. Harper's budget surplus is slated to be a 1Billion dollar deficit. We have a higher child poverty rate than the global average of comparable nations. Things aren't looking good regardless of how the current government is spinning it. We need a reality check and some innovative long-term strategizing to get us out of this mess. Printing out government cheques (child tax credits etc) to buy people’s votes while we're in this situation is unconscionable and completely irresponsible.</p></div>
